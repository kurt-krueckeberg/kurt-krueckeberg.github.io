Since the 2013 copyright (that was located in the footer in the October 16, 2021, WayBackMachine version) has expired, the [German Emigration Records](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/http://www.genealoger.com/german/ger_emigration_records.htm)
was converted to [Sphinx-doc and Restructured Text](https://sphinx-doc.com).

Each entry is currently being double checked. Many broken links have been corrected, many other sources and their links added; in the case of broken links where no correct current link could be found, the entry was removed.
