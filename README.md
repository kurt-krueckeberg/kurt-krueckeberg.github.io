# German Emigration Records

Most of the information originally came from the now defunct `Genealoger.com`. It was extracted from the
October 16, 2021, WayBackMachine version of www.genealoger.com/german/ger_emigration_records.htm.

Since the 2013 copyright (that located in the footer in the WayBackMachine version) has expired, the German Emigration Records was converted to Github-flavored Markdown and placed here.

Each entry was double checked. Many broken links have been corrected, other sources and their links added; in the case of broken links were no correct current link could be found, the entry was removed.
