# German Emigration Records

## Comments

Most of the information originally came from the now defunct `Genealoger.com` website. It was extracted from the
October 16, 2021, WayBackMachine version of www.genealoger.com/german/ger_emigration_records.htm.

Since the 2013 copyright (that located in the footer in the WayBackMachine version) has expired, the German Emigration Records was converted to Github-flavored Markdown and placed in a github
repository, from which this website is generated.

Each original entry was double checked (although this process is not complete). Many broken links have been corrected, other sources and their links added; in the case of broken links were no correct current
link could be found, the entry was removed.
