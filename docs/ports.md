## Bremen

The Bremen Family History Society (Gesellschaft für Familienforschung e.V.) has presevered  [Bremen passenger lists](https://www.passagierlisten.de/) from the period
1920-1939.

These passenger lists from the period 1920-1939 were archived in the Bremen Chamber of Commerce, the holdings
of the Federal Archives in Koblenz, from 1907/08 and 1913/14, which now are in the Bremen State Archives, and various
holdings in the Bremen State Archives.

Bremen began keeping passenger lists in 1832, but most lists have been destroyed. Unfortunately, all lists from 1875-1908 older
than 3 years were destroyed due to lack of space in the Bremen Archives. With the exception of 3017 passenger lists for the years
1920-1939 all other lists were lost in World War II.

Some reconstructed passenger lists have been published. See ***German Immigrants — Lists of Passengers Bound from Bremen to New York, 4 volumes*** below.

[Dutch Immigrants to America, 1820-1880](https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/7914/) a Ancestry database of Dutch immigration to America.

**Description:**

This database contains information on over 56,000 Dutch immigrants who came to America between 1820 and 1880. The information was extracted from the National Archives passenger lists of ships arriving at various Atlantic and Gulf ports. The list includes vessels disembarking at Baltimore, Boston, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia and other smaller ports. The passenger lists used in this compilation includes approximately 100,000 separate ship manifests.

The following information is included in this index: name; gender; age; occupation; last residence; port of embarkation; port of arrival; date of arrival; intended destination; family status; National Archives microfilm series number; National Archive microfilm roll number; name of vessel. It is important that you use the National Archives microfilm information to locate your ancestor in the original records as more information is usually found in an original record than is found in an index. These records may also be found on microfilm at the Family History Library (FHL). Both the NARA and FHL copies may be available through your local National Archives branch and Family History Center.

consists of original passenger lists from 1820 through 1897. While the entire microfilm series spans 675 rolls, the information collected here covers rolls 433
through 635. It includes individuals who arrived between January 1, 1820 and December 31, 1897. The information that you can learn will help create a well-rounded
picture of your Dutch ancestor's arrival in America.

The following information is included in this index: name; gender; birthplace; age; occupation; country of origin; port of embarkation; ship accommodations;
port of arrival; date of arrival; intended destination; family status; occupation; National Archive microfilm roll number; National Archives list number;
name of ship (often the type of ship is noted as well).
