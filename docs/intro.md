# Introduction

Many German emigrants exited through the ports of Bremerhaven and
Cuxhaven. Bremerhaven was the port of Bremen because the Bremen port was
full of silt and needed dredging.  Ships could not get into Bremen.
Cuxhaven was the port for Hamburg. Other German ports were primarily
located along the eastern sea board and included Stettin, Gdansk
(Danzig), Libau, Memel, and Riga. Germans also used Scandinavian ports
(especially Copenhagen). The ports in Antwerp, Belgium, and Le Havre,
France, were also used.

## Some Causes for German Emigration

1. *Compulsory military conscription* was unpopular.  Many young men
    emigrated without permission in order to avoid military service. It
    has been estimated that more than fifty percent of young men of
    military age emigrated illegally.

2. In the early 1800s, an *economic depression and over-population*
    caused restrictions on marriages and attempts to limit growth in
    poor areas of the south and central Germany. Young couples in these
    areas often emigrated separately or together, often with
    illegitimate children.

3. *Only three religions were allowed in German lands: Catholic,
    Lutheran and Reformed*. Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III united
    the Reformed (Calvinist) and Lutheran churches in **1817** on the
    300th anniversary of the Reformation. These *religious restrictions*
    caused some to emigrate for religious convictions.

4. Industrialization in the mid **1800s** created many new jobs, but
    also caused the *decline of the cottage industries* which had kept
    many families from starving. The hardest hit were the linen weavers
    who worked on looms in their homes. *Mechanical looms and the
    competition from foreign markets drove many to pack up and leave*.

5. *Rising grain prices* in the early **1830s**, mid **1840s**, and
    **1850s** created a hardship on sustaining a family.

6. *Some communities tried to get rid of the chronically
    underprivileged members of the society*, with some towns paying the
    passage costs in exchange for the individual giving up all
    citizenship rights and promising not to return.

7. Improved transportation with the removal of tolls on the Rhine, Main
    and Neckar rivers in the 1830s, made it *cheaper to travel to a port
    city*. The railroad miles also doubled by **1846-47**.

8. *Industrialization* wiped out home industries such as spinning,
    weaving, etc.

9. *Land prices were increasing*, but the income produced from the land
    did not have the corresponding increase. Selling the land rights
    often provided enough money to allow a family to emigrate.

10. Some *farm sizes had become so small* that they no longer could
    support a family.

11. From **1830-1845**, growing grapes for the wine industry was
    unstable, and a series of bad crops caused many to emigrate.

12. The largest share of taxes and military personnel came from
    tradesmen, farmers, artisans, and laborers. Many did not want their
    children to feel the brunt of upcoming wars, unemployment,
    indebtedness, and impoverishment.

13. Relatives or friends who had already emigrated sent positive reports
    back to their hometown. Their reports encouraged others to follow.

14. Some political refugees, especially after the failed **1848**
    revolution, decided to leave.

15. Many shipping companies employed agents who actively canvassed
    specific geographic areas and wrote up shipping contracts with
    prospective emigrants.

16. Reports of cheap land in other countries lured people to leave.

## Some Destination Sites for the Emigrants

- Many from the crowded south of the German areas in the **1700s**
    moved to new Prussian lands opening in Pomerania, West and East
    Prussia, Silesia, and Posen.

- Hungary, Spain, Russia, and France were other destinations which
    developed German-speaking pockets.

- Following the Thirty Years' War in 1648, the Swiss moved in to
    rebuild destroyed regions, but this did not always work out as
    planned.

- In the **1700s**, it is estimated that 830,000 Germans emigrated to
    Russia, while only 125,000 went to America. Catherine the Great
    invited German farmers to emigrate to her unsettled frontier in the
    southern Ukraine along the Black Sea and the Sea of Azor. About
    37,000 accepted the 1763 invitation.

- From **1717-1775**, most of the Germans going to America landed in
    Philadelphia and gave Pennsylvania the largest German population.

## Some Emigration Events

- In the early **1700s**, the first major region to emigrate was from
    the Palatinate, Hesse, southern Rhineland, parts of Baden and
    Württemberg. Reasons for this included: inherited land parcels
    became too small to support a family, the area was under constant
    threat of war or recovering from a war, the ongoing struggle with
    neighboring France, and the winter of **1708-09** devastated the
    wine industry for years and jeopardized the jobs in that region.

- Mennonite miners and their families found jobs in the Virginia
    ironworks.

- Baptist Dunkers left in **1729**.

- Salzburg Lutherans moved to Georgia in **1731**.

- Schwenkfelders left in **1734**.

- Moravian Brethren left after **1735**.

- Around **1815**, authorities in the southwest German areas paid to
    have their poor shipped to America.

- Baden liberalized their emigration laws in **1803**, Württemberg in
    **1815**, Prussia in **1818**, and Hesse in **1821**.

- From the **1700** to the late 1840s, emigration from Hesse was
    popular and affordable, but the increased poverty in the late
    **1840** allowed only the small families and individuals to afford
    the costs of emigration.

- From the **mid-1820s** to **1850s**, LeHarve became an important
    port for Germans from Württemberg, Baden, Alsace and Switzerland.

- From 1844-1847, about 7,000 Hessians headed to the hill country of
    Texas.

- It is estimated than about 20,000 Hessians emigrated to America in
    **1854**. Of the number, over 9,000 were from Hesse-Kassel.

- From 1848-1854, approximately 773,000 Germans emigrated to America,
    with nearly 2/3 of them from Hesse-Kassel, Hesse-Darmstadt, the
    Palatinate, Baden and Württemberg.

- Emigration spread beyond Württemburg and along the Rhine after
    **1830**.

- After **1850**, most of Mecklenburg’s emigrants consisted mainly of
    day laborers and farmhands.

- About 800 Rappites (or Harmonists) emigrated from northwest
    Württemberg from **1803-1805**, with most coming through the ports
    of Baltimore or Philadelphia.

- German-speakers from northern Alsace (Bas-Rhin) were encouraged to
    leave during the **1820** and 30s, and those from southern Alsace
    (Haut-Rhin) after **1843**.

- In the **1830** and **1840** southern Hanover and northern
    Westphalia saw heavy emigration with the drop in linen prices and
    years of poor harvests. Spinners and weavers in Silesia were also
    hard hit by the introduction of mechanical looms.

- Nassau had the highest per capita emigration rate in the **1800s**.

- Following the First Schleswig War in **1851**, many defeated
    soldiers left for eastern Iowa.

- Peak years for emigration from Westphalia included **1833-1850s**
    and 1880-1885. Many headed to Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, and
    South Dakota.

- With the the exit of many lower middle class small farmers, village
    shopkeepers, and artisans, emigration from Baden peaked between
    **1847** and 1857.
