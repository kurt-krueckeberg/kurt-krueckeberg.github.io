## History of this Documentaion

Much of the information on this site is from the defunct webiste `Genealoger.com`, whose [October 16, 2021 version](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/http://www.genealoger.com/german/ger_emigration_records.htm)
is in the archives of the [WaybackMacine](https://wayback.archive.org).

Since the 2013 copyright (located in the footer of the October 16, 2021, WayBackMachine version) has expired, the [German Emigration Records](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/http://www.genealoger.com/german/ger_emigration_records.htm)
was converted to [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

Each entry is currently being double checked; many broken links have been corrected; other sources and their links added; in the case of broken links where no correct current link could be found, the entry was removed.

Go to [German Emigration Records](german_emig_recs.md).
