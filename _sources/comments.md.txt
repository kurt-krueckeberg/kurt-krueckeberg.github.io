Most of the information originally here came from the now defunct `Genealoger.com`. It was extracted from the **October 16, 2021,
WayBackMachine** version of
[www.genealoger.com/german/ger_emigration_records.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/http://www.genealoger.com/german/ger_emigration_records.htm).

Since the 2013 copyright (that was located in the footer in the October 16, 2021, WayBackMachine version) has expired, the [German Emigration Records](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/http://www.genealoger.com/german/ger_emigration_records.htm)
was converted to [Github-flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

Each entry is currently being double checked. Many broken links have been corrected, other sources and their links added; in the case of broken links where no correct current link could be found, the entry was removed.
